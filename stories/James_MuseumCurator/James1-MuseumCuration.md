# Plant perspectives

## Persona
As a Museum Curator responsible for the Sloane Collections, James wants to ensure that the contributions of both documented and invisible collectors of plant specimens are acknowledged and represented in the museum's records.

## Goal

To accurately document and represent the contributions of both documented and invisible collectors of plant specimens in the Sloane Collections.

## Scenario

James is tasked with curating the plant specimens within the Sloane Collections. He wants to ensure that the records not only include information about the documented collectors but also acknowledge the contributions of local communities or indigenous groups who may have gathered specimens but were historically overlooked or invisible in the records. James aims to provide a more inclusive and accurate representation of the collectors' diverse perspectives and knowledge.

## Competency questions

CQ1: How can the contributions of both documented and invisible collectors of plant specimens be addressed within the information records?
CQ2: What are the contrasting opinions about the material, provenance, technique, function, and attribution of a specific plant specimen?
CQ3: How can uncertainty about the function of a plant specimen be represented within the information records?
CQ4: Are there mentions, or lack thereof, of specific agents within the information records for plant specimens?
CQ5: How can the contributions of both documented and invisible local knowledge sharers be acknowledged and captured within the information records?

## Resources

James uses:

- Plant specimens museum catalogues

James could be helped by:
- A technology to visualize interconnections, e.g. of plant specimens which share the same local knowledge contributions.
- A technology to seek for relations and connetions between plant specimen records and their interpretations.
